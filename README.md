# 🧭 A* Pathfinding Visualization with Vue

## 🌟 Overview

This project implements a **visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm** using **Vue.js 3**. It provides a user-friendly interface to visualize how the A* algorithm works in finding the shortest path in a grid, considering obstacles and different heuristics. The project is built with Vue 3 and utilizes **Element Plus** for UI components and **Vite** for fast development.

## 🛠️ Features

- **🖱️ Interactive Grid**: Users can draw obstacles, set start and end points on the grid, and see the pathfinding algorithm in action.
- **🔄 Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization**: The algorithm's progress is visually displayed with animations showing the open and closed nodes.
- **🎯 Multiple Heuristics**: Supports different heuristics like Manhattan and Euclidean distances for comparison.
- **✨ Element Plus Integration**: The UI uses Element Plus for a clean and modern design.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- **Vue 3**: Frontend framework
- **Element Plus**: UI component library
- **Vite**: Build tool
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript for better development experience and type safety

## 🚀 Installation

### 📋 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
